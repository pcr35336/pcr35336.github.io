<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);"> Bexley was adopted by the Rogers Family on May 25, 2013, to which he has now grown to be a huge good boy. He has learned many tricks and is very disciplined. He is very respectful of his toys and all the new friends he meets everyday. He has a minor licking problem but he does it out of love. Bexley also has a huge appetite for treats and it has led to a weight problem, although he recently was given a "dog fit-bit" that tracks and monitors his walking and calorie burning activities and is on his way to a healthy body again. </p>
